## Better Terminal Experience with Prezto

### Disclaimer
I am an *absolute newby* to serious coding. Now that since my coworkers run their Python script on terminal (whereas where I used to do is either Jupyter Notebook or Spider), and that I'm required to use Git every day, I'm starting to use the Terminal a lot, or shell, console, command line, whatever you call that scary black and white window with only a cursor to navigate through. <br><br>
Fortunately a friend pointed me to this repo: [Prezto](https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto), and it was so good that made me want to write this. <br><br>
Installing it could:
* enable using alias to your daily commands (e.g., type gcm when you used to type git commit -m)
* display the git branch and the git status on the terminal, when you are in a git repo
* fast cd to a directory you've recently visited (whereas what I used to do is constantly cd and ls and pwd) by just typing part of that directory name
* syntax highlighting
These are the features that I found extremely useful. There must be more to find :)
