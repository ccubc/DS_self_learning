"""
Given a function  f(x, y) and a value z, return all positive integer pairs x and y where f(x,y) == z.

The function is constantly increasing, i.e.:

f(x, y) < f(x + 1, y)
f(x, y) < f(x, y + 1)
The function interface is defined like this: 

interface CustomFunction {
public:
  // Returns positive integer f(x, y) for any given positive integer x and y.
  int f(int x, int y);
};
For custom testing purposes you're given an integer function_id and a target z as input, where function_id represent one function from an secret internal list, on the examples you'll know only two functions from the list.  

You may return the solutions in any order.

 

Example 1:

Input: function_id = 1, z = 5
Output: [[1,4],[2,3],[3,2],[4,1]]
Explanation: function_id = 1 means that f(x, y) = x + y
Example 2:

Input: function_id = 2, z = 5
Output: [[1,5],[5,1]]
Explanation: function_id = 2 means that f(x, y) = x * y
 

Constraints:

1 <= function_id <= 9
1 <= z <= 100
It's guaranteed that the solutions of f(x, y) == z will be on the range 1 <= x, y <= 1000
It's also guaranteed that f(x, y) will fit in 32 bit signed integer if 1 <= x, y <= 1000
