### Git cheatsheet

#### Useful terminal commands:
* `ls`: list files and directories
* `mkdir`: create a new directory
* `cd`: change directories
* `rm`: remove files and directories
* `pwd`: print working directory


#### Create a Git Repo
* `git init`: create brand new repos from scratch on your computer
* `git clone`: copy existing repos from somewhere else to your local computer  <br>
When cloning a repo, make sure the terminal's current working directory isn't located in a Git repo. (cannot nest Git repos). Git clone will create a new directory. 
```
git clone https://github.com/...  # clone a repo
git clone https://github.com/... new_repo_name  # clone a repo and rename
```

* `git status`: check the status of the repo
